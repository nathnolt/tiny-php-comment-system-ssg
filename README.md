# tiny php comment system ssg
Tiny PHP comment system for SSG like Hugo (1 file)

# Install
just add it somewhere in the site, then add <iframe src="/comment-system/?slug=post1"> elements like this which point to the PHP 
folder that contains the comment system, combined with a slug paramenter.

# Styling
Just edit the <style> element inside of the PHP file.

# Motivation
I don't like existing systems, (Then again, I haven't tried any systems, and also Haven't looked at many systems at all) because it's mostly extremely large for what seems like a simple task, or you have to login, or it requires JavaScript.
  I bet there are more people that do exactly the same thing I do, but because they all name their stuff differently, it's impossible to find it.
  I also wanted to try it myself, just to see how far I would get.

# Todo
- Add a system with e-mail, so that en e-mail will be sent when you get a message
- Actually battle test it out in the field
